    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F or 180°C. Grease a 9x13-inch (about 22 x 33 cm) oven dish with vegan butter</li>
        <li>Wash and cut the apples into four pieces, core them, and cut them into thin wedges with a small paring knife. Add the apple slices to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the juice of half a lemon, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of grated ginger, and a grating of nutmeg.        </li>
        <li>Toss well until all is combined.</li>
        <li>Transfer the apple mixture to the prepared oven dish and push the apples down to fit snuggly.        </li>
        <li>Top the apples with the chopped pecans. You’ll need about 1/2 cup of them.        </li>
        <li>To a food processor, add 3/4 cup of flour, 3/4 cup of rolled oats, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, one pinch of salt, and 1/2 cup of cold diced vegan butter.        </li>
        <li>Pulse until you get a crumbly topping with a coarse, sandy texture. You know you are done when the butter has absorbed most of the flour.        </li>
        <li>Crumble the flour mixture on the apples, trying to cover the pecan pieces.        </li>
        <li>Bake at 350°F or 180°C for about 45 minutes on the second lowest oven rack, below the center rack.        </li>
        <li>You know it’s ready when the apples are tender and juicy and the crisp is golden brown.        </li>
    </ol>
