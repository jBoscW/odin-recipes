    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps menu" style="padding-left: 50px;">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F or 190°C.        </li>
        <li>Add flour, sugar, salt, and cold-diced vegan butter to a food processor.        </li>
        <li>Pulse a few times until you have a coarse mixture, then add 2 to 4 tablespoons of water and keep pulsing a few more times until the butter absorbs the flour.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture onto a clean worktop and lightly knead it until it becomes a dough ball.        </li>
        <li>Divide the dough into two parts. One part should be slightly bigger than the other (the base of the pie) and one slightly smaller (for the cutouts on top).</li>
        <li>Roll out each dough ball between two sheets of parchment paper, ensuring the larger disc is large enough to cover the pie dish.        </li>
        <li>You can sprinkle the pastry dough with flour so that it’s easier to roll out.</li>
        <li>Set aside in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or in the freezer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Arrange the larger pie crust on your pie dish without the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Pierce the bottom with a fork.        </li>
        <li>Flute the edges of the pie crust with your fingers or with the back of a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Cover the pie crust with a crinkled sheet of parchment paper, then add baking beans (pie weights).</li>
        <li>Cut out some stars, hearts, or other shapes with the other sheet of pie crust.</li>
        <li>Arrange both the pie dish and the cutouts on a baking tray.</li>
        <li>Bake the crust with the baking beans in the oven at 375°F or 190°C for 15 minutes. Then, carefully remove the beans (they are hot) and the parchment paper and bake the crust empty for 12 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Prepare this while the crust is baking.</li>
        <li>Add the filling ingredients to a medium-sized pot or saucepan: pumpkin puree, coconut milk, sugar, cornstarch, vanilla extract, cinnamon, allspice, ground cloves, ground ginger, grated nutmeg, and salt.</li>
        <li>Whisk well off the heat until all combined, then cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring often.        </li>
        <li>Take the cooked pie crust out of the oven, pour the hot pumpkin pie filling, and spread it with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake a final time for 10 to 15 minutes.        </li>
        <li>The filling won’t set entirely yet; it will as the pie cools down</li>
        <li>Let the vegan pumpkin pie cool down completely, then chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours if you want the perfect slice.        </li>
        <li>Before serving it, you can garnish it with vegan whipped cream, topped with the pastry cutouts you made earlier.        </li>
    </ol>
