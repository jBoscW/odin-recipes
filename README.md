# odin-recipes

In this project, I will use my newly acquired HTML, command line, and CSS (?) knowledge to do the first Odin assignment, namely a 'basic recipe website'. 

I think this will mostly 'prove' of showing my knowledge of basic HTML, including text formatting (bolds, italics, body, head, titles, headers), images, links, and lists.
